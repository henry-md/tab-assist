# TabAssist: Context-Aware AI Chrome Extension

## Project Proposal
TabAssist is an AI-powered Chrome extension that enhances how users interact with their open browser tabs. By analyzing the content of active tabs, it provides a conversational interface that synthesizes information, answers questions, and connects insights across multiple sources. This tool streamlines research, shopping, and information management, making it easier to extract value from open web pages in real-time.

## Functional Requirements

### General Features
- Chrome extension interface for managing open tabs
- Utilize anonymous authentication from Convex for session management
- Extract and process content from active and grouped tabs
- Provide a chat interface for user interactions

### AI Features
- Maintain crawled context in memory in the chat
- Answer questions based on open tab content
- Generate quick summaries of tab content
- Identify key topics and themes across multiple tabs
- Extract and compare specifications from different sources
- Generate a citation list from research articles or reports
- Highlight relevant sections across tabs in AI responses


### Optional Features (if time permits)
- Recrawl tabs for real-time content updates
- Support different AI models per user preference
- Use content embedding to optimize context for answering queries
- Search across saved tabs semantically
- Compare and contrast content from different sources
- Highlight relevant information from specific tabs
- Implement regeneration of AI responses with adjusted temperature

### Nice-to-have Features (won't be implemented)
- Quick summary view of all saved tabs
- Ability to selectively include tabs in AI context
- Save and export conversations
- Integration with Chrome’s built-in tab management
- Support for PDF and image content extraction
- Image recognition and analysis from tab content
- Automatic tab organization suggestions

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Chrome Extension (Manifest V3)
- React for UI components
- TailwindCSS and Shadcn UI for styling

### Backend
- OpenAI API for AI features
- Convex for conversation storage
- WebSocket server for real-time updates
- Web scraping tools (e.g., Puppeteer, BeautifulSoup) for extracting page content

### Development Tools
- Vite for development
- ESLint for code quality
- Jest for testing
